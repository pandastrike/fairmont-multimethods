# Fairmont

[Fairmont](https://github.com/pandastrike/fairmont) is a JavaScript library for functional reactive programming. Fairmont takes full advantage of ES6+ features like iterators (including async iterators), generators, and promises. Inspired by libraries like [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and many others, Fairmont features include:

* reactive programming support through async iterators
* lazy evaluation on collection operations via iterators
* core functional operations, like currying and composition
* bridge functions for integrating with OOP-based libraries
* common file and stream based operations
* streams and event emitters modeled as asynchronous iterators
* seamless integration between synchronous and asynchronous operations
* â€¦ and more!

## Examples

You can get a feel for what Fairmont can do for you by [checking out the examples](https://github.com/pandastrike/fairmont-reactive/tree/master/examples).

## Reference

Fairmont uses [literate programming](http://www.coffeescriptlove.com/2013/02/literate-coffeescript.html), so each source file doubles as documentation. Please see the [source directory](./src/index.litcoffee) for more.

## Status

Fairmont is still under heavy development and is `beta` quality, meaning you should probably not use it in your production code.

## Roadmap

You can get an idea of what we're planning by looking at the [issues list][200]. If you want something that isn't there, and you think it would be a good addition, please open a ticket.
